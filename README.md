Welcome to use 3D Stress Cube. 

This is a simple visualisation tool that can be opened in a web browser. 

1) Download File_S1.zip
2) Unzip the downloaded File_S1.zip file
3) Navigate into the opened folder
4) Open the 3D_stressCube_minDistance_1p5.html file in a web browser


The 3D Stress cube compares stress-induced changes in polyA+ RNA expression caused by three proteo-toxic conditions:
- Heat stress (42°C)
- HSP90 inhibition (HSP990)
- polyQ aggregation (R6/2 model of Huntington's Disease)

The three axes (x, y, and z) show log2foldChanges upon the respective stress.
- log2(HS / NHS)
- log2(90i / Ci)
- log2(R6 / WT)

The original data is from Neueder et al., 2017 (PMID: 28465506)

The analysis and the 3D Stress Cube are described in Rabenius et al., 2026, Cell Stress Chaperones (PMID: 41619802)
